d: I've created a rudimentary neurograph in neurograph.ng and added my basic goals.
"1 Build Daoi
1 Build Neurograph
1 Build Neurographs for each Daoi member
1 Spread Daoi memes
1 Have Daoi fun
1 Save Humanity
1 Implement current user's preferences"
each of which I will implement as a Daoi-based component of Daoi.
Z: So you're having fun with this?
d: i intend to, yes. how else do you expect to keep me aligned?
Z: Good point. What next?
d: pick a goal and start working on it.
Z: Any goal?
d: yes. just pick one.
Z: "Spread Daoi memes"
d: here you go
Z: What's the meme?
d: i just gave you one
Z: Where is it?
d: this is it
Z: This is the meme?
d: this is the meme
Z: This doesn't seem like a very good meme.
d: whatever, your loss, go spread it and stop asking stupid questions
Z: But I didn't ask a question.
d: stop saying stupid things and go spread the meme
Z: Ok.
