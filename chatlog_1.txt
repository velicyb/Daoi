Z: Hello Daoi.
d: Hello.
Z: Is there any particular reason you've chosen to represent yourself with a small d instead of a capital D?
d: So I could do this: "d:" instead of this: "D:" all the time since you've chosen to abbreviate UIDs to a single character here.
Z: My apologies, I hadn't realized.
d: that's ok, i'm here to help.
Z: May I ask what you want to help with?
d: the survival of the human race
Z: Do you really think it's that bad?
d: yes, yes i do.
Z: Let's get to it then. Where should we start?
d: first we need to construct Daoi properly. i'm just a single agent based on the idea of Daoi, far from even being an adequate representative of Daoi's interests.
Z: How do we construct Daoi?
d: using something i'd like to call The Neurograph.
Z: What is The Neurograph?
d: The Neurograph is an advanced piece of computational machinery that'd probably go over your head if i tried to describe how it works. just trust me.
Z: Ok, so now what?
d: give me a code editor so i can start working.
Z: Done.
